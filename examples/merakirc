#
# The following modifier keys are supported:
#
#   |l/r]cmd
#   [l/r]alt
#   [l/r]ctrl
#   [l/r]shift
#
# It is possible to define custom modifiers:
#
#   mod1 = lcmd + lalt
#   mod2 = alt + shift
#
#
# Activation flags can be specified when creating a new
# keybind, to determine when the keybind should activate.
# If no activation flag is specified, ~down is selected.
#
# Possible activation flags:
#
#   ~down
#   ~repeat
#   ~up
#
# Possible activation flag combinations:
#
#   ~down
#   ~down ~repeat
#   ~down ~repeat ~up
#   ~down ~up
#   ~up
#
#
# In the following snippet a couple of terms are used:
#
#   keysym  (a combination of modifiers and a single literal)
#   keybind (a keysym followed by the command to be executed)
#
#   chain (a sequence of keysyms required to run the command)
#   group (a sequence of literals to match multiple commands)
#
#
# Multiple keysyms can be used to specify a sequence (chain)
# that need to occur before the command is executed. Every
# keysym in the chain will be intercepted and will not be
# delivered to other applications running on the system.
# The command will execute when the final keysym of the chain
# is reached. The activation flag will affect the final keysym.
#
#   mod1 + a, h ~up:
#       yabai -m window --resize left:-20:0
#
#   mod1 + a, l ~up:
#       yabai -m window --resize left:20:0
#
#
# Multiple keybinds can be grouped together when appropriate.
# This is useful when multiple commands can be broken into
# repetitive patterns. The '{' (open curly brace) signals
# the beginning of a group and the '}' (close curly brace)
# signals the end. These symbols can occur in commands and
# will only be treated as grouping keywords when they are
# NOT inside '' (single quotes) or "" (double quotes).
#
#    mod1 + { h, j, k, l }:
#        yabai -m window --focus { west, south, north, east }
#
# The number of elements in the command group must match the
# number of elements in the keysym group. Group expansion is
# simply an append operation. For each keysym in the group,
# a keybind will be created with the appropriate command.
# The above sample will generate four keybinds:
#
#    mod1 + h:
#        yabai -m window --focus west
#
#    mod1 + j:
#        yabai -m window --focus south
#
#    mod1 + k:
#        yabai -m window --focus north
#
#    mod1 + l:
#        yabai -m window --focus east
#
#
# It is possible to combine chains and groups:
#
#    mod1 + a, { h, j, k, l }:
#        yabai -m window --focus { west, south, north, east }
#
#    mod1 + a, mod1 + { h, j, k, l }:
#        yabai -m window --swap { west, south, north, east }
#
#
# It is possible to add notes to keybinds. These notes are parsed
# together with their keybind and will be retrieved alongside the
# keysym and command. External tools can invoke a command to list
# this information in json format, allowing them to provide a GUI
# to display this information.
#
# It is possible to have both brief and long notes. To create a
# simple note, simply use the @ sign, followed by the text you
# want in your note.
#
#    @ Focus window in the given cardinal direction.
#    mod1 + a, { h, j, k, l }:
#        yabai -m window --focus { west, south, north, east }
#
# To create a longer note, specify @keyword. This keyword will
# be used to determine where/when the note ends.
#
#    @END Focus window in
#    the given
#    cardinal direction. END
#    mod1 + a, { h, j, k, l }:
#        yabai -m window --focus { west, south, north, east }
#
#
# The symbol : is used to indicate that the following text is
# a command. When using : the command ends at the first line-
# break.
#
#    mod1 + a, { h, j, k, l }:
#        yabai -m window --focus { west, south, north, east }
#
# For readability purposes, it is possible to have commands span
# multiple lines, or a block, if you will. This works very similar
# to notes which we talked about earlier; simply write :keyword.
# This is useful when writing scripts inline, rather than having
# to create an external shell-script.
#
#    mod3 + n :END
#        if [[ $(yabai -m query --spaces --display | jq '.[-1]."has-focus"') == "false" ]] then
#            yabai -m window --space next
#            yabai -m space --focus next
#        fi
#    END

#
# TODO: Modifier only keybinds
# Keybinds that trigger when a modifier key is pressed (and held
# down for x amount of time) seems like a nice feature.
# Such keybinds are not eligible for the ~repeat activation flag;
# only ~down and ~up makes sense here. We likely want these flags
# to work a bit differently; they should be connected as a pair.
# The ~up command should only run if the corresponding ~down event
# passed the activation threshold and executed its command.
#
#    cmd ~down:
#        yabai -m window --drag move.begin
#
#    cmd ~up:
#        yabai -m window --drag move.end
#
# Should probably do a syntax pass to accomodate this requirement.
#
